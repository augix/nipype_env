# Docker Nipype Environment

This Docker image provides a basic Nipype environment, including AFNI and FSL dependencies.

It is based on the dockerfiles 'crn_base' and 'crn_nipype' from the Poldrack Lab (https://github.com/poldracklab/crn_base),  the dockerfile biss2016-notebook from Oscar Esteban under https://hub.docker.com/u/oesteban and the dockerfiles from the neurovault (https://github.com/NeuroVault/NeuroVault). This means that the same copyrights apply to this Dockerfile, as they do for the files most of this content is coming from.
